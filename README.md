# Autowall
Autowall is a very simple script to automatically download and set wallpapers from [Wallhaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc/)

## Installation
You need to have a wm that uses [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) to set wallpaper.
This is a tool primarily designed for window manager users and not for desktop environments.

Just clone and run ` sh install.sh `.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/begbaj/autowall
cd autowall
sh install.sh
```
